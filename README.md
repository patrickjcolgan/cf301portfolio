###User Stories: MVP
As the creator, I want the Home and About nav links to act as tabs, so my story is revealed FAST.
This means your links to NOT navigate to a new page. **done**

Instead, your "single page app" shows only the section related to the navigation tab that is selected.**done**

As a reader, I want the portfolio to use a nice color scheme, so that it stands out visually.**TO DO**
7C7676: SILVER
5177FF: BLUE
0D1602: BLACK

### User Stories: Stretch Goals
As a reader, I want project descriptions truncated to the first paragraph so that I can easily scroll though the whole list. **OMIT**
As a reader, I want to click the "More" button so that I can expand the entire description.**BUTTON EXISTS: not functional yet**
As a reader, I want projects filterable by category so that I can review just the things that interest me.
Technical Requirements and Grading Rubric **DONE**

Use event delegation whenever appropriate.
Add your filters to the Nav section.
Do as much work as you can with advanced selectors, rather than littering your markup with classes and ids.
When classes and IDs are needed, pick semantic names. There is to be no $('#content .content') nonsense!
Add color and icons where appropriate.**TO DO**

## Branch: Class03
User Stories: MVP

As a visitor, I want the images to be responsive, so that content stays properly proportioned.**DONE**

As a visitor, I want the viewport properly sized, so that content fits all the size I have available.**DONE (did during class02 assigment)**
As a visitor, I want the primary nav to be responsive, so that I can get around using any device **DONE**

Stretch Goals:
As a visitor, I want to see projects one per row on mobile, so that I can read the detail easily **done (but they are always one per row. What am I missing?)

** More layout styling **
** Nav button styling? **
